FizzBuzzEfficiency contains multiple implementations of the FizzBuzz algorithm that uses different approaches such as loop unrolling
to optimize the runtime and measures the efficiency of the different approaches

cs201_a1 is a typing game implemented in C
cs201_hw3 is a cyclic redundency check algorithm implemented in assembly
